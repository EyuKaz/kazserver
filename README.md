# 🚀 **Kaz: The Sexiest Server You'll Ever Code With** 🚀

Welcome to the **Kaz Web Server** – the server so smooth, it'll make Apache blush and Nginx jealous. This isn't just a web server; it's a **full-blown PHP-powered experience** that'll make you question why you ever used anything else. Fast, lightweight, and with a sense of humor, this server is here to serve your files and steal your heart. ❤️

## 🌟 **Features That'll Make You Swoon**

- **Pure PHP Magic**: No frameworks, no bloat, just raw PHP power. It's like coding in the Matrix, but with fewer leather coats.
- **Static File Serving**: Serves HTML, CSS, JS, and images like a butler with a silver platter. 🍸
- **Routing System**: Define routes so clean, they'll make your code look like it was written by Shakespeare.
- **Error Handling**: When things go wrong (and they will), it handles errors with the grace of a ballet dancer. 🩰
- **Security**: Built-in sanitization and security headers to keep the bad guys out. Think of it as a bouncer for your web app. 🚪
- **Customizable**: Tweak it, break it, fix it – it's your server now. Own it. 💪
